# Enterprise Network Design ‚Äì Cisco Packet Tracer Project

This repository contains a **Cisco Packet Tracer project (.pkt)** that simulates an enterprise-level network with **multiple HQs, branch networks, servers, VLANs, dynamic routing, and security policies**.  

The design showcases **end-to-end networking skills** across subnetting, routing, switching, NAT, ACLs, DHCP, and firewalling.

## üìå Project Overview
The project demonstrates the design and configuration of a multi-site enterprise network with the following components:

- **HQ1 & HQ2** networks with multiple VLANs
- **Shipping Company Servers** with Static NAT for public access
- **User Network** using DHCP for IP assignment
- **Public Network backbone** interconnecting HQs and external sites
- **Security features** including ACLs and Zone-Based Firewall (ZPF)

## üõ†Ô∏è Networking Features Implemented
1. **Subnetting** ‚Äì from `192.168.1.0/24` into multiple subnets  
2. **IP Addressing** ‚Äì IP assignments with proper subnet masks and default gateways  
3. **VLANs** ‚Äì segmentation for departments (VLAN 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 99)  
4. **Basic Device Configuration** ‚Äì hostnames, passwords, SSH, VLANs on switches  
5. **Static Routing** ‚Äì used for specific point-to-point connections  
6. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** ‚Äì dynamic routing protocol across routers  
7. **NAT/PAT** ‚Äì translating internal private IPs to public IPs  
8. **DHCP** ‚Äì dynamic IP assignment for end-user devices  
9. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** ‚Äì traffic filtering and access restrictions  
10. **Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZPF)** ‚Äì for advanced perimeter security  
11. **Server Configurations** ‚Äì accessible using **Static NAT**  
12. **End Devices** ‚Äì PCs, laptops, and tablets connected to VLANs and DHCP
